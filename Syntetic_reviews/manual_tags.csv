"So, since I own quite a few of quick dry shirts (8-10), I was skeptical about buying these at this low price for two (Two blues). But I'm very satisfied with the quality, looks, and feel. I'm 195 lbs (5-10) and the XL's that I bought fit just right. Good arm length and good length at the waist. The blues colors are very nice. My other blue quick dry shirt is a very dark blue, almost black, but these have a better blue color. Good buy!",,1,1,,,1,,,,
"I think I like these shirts more than any other shirt I've worn in the summer heat. Very comfortable fabric, very good fit and the quality is great. I own about 10 of them now and no problems yet. I do wish they had more color combos, like blue/black, grey/grey, grey/blue.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"I live in Vegas and ordered a pair of these and a pair of Copper Fit (which i wear the long sleeves in the winter while riding). These Essential are so much better than the Copper Fit short sleeves, and at half the price too.",,,,,,1,,,,
I love this shirts. They fit perfect and are very breathable. I suggest to have an option available to choose two shirts of the same color for each color.,,,1,,,,,,,
"These are great for workout, walking, running. Comfortable, nothing fancy. Would buy again.",,,1,,,,,,,
"I love these shirts. They are very light weight and comfortable. I played two hours of pickleball and my shirt wasn't wet or sticking to me even though my hat was drenched with sweat. They kept me dry. I'm 6'3"" 180 39"" chest. I bought a medium and it fit perfectly. I like the length of the shirt. It wasn't too long.",,,1,,,,,,,
"I've purchased 3 - 3 packs of different color variations. Been very pleased with the fit and how well they breathe and absorb sweat during my workouts. I enjoy wearing them both to the gym and out and about on a nice summer day. I'm a huge Under Armour fan. However, considering the price and fit of the Devops tank tops, I've invested only in this brand for best bang for the buck. Seller is very professional and was helpful with some questions I had. Highly recommend!",,,1,,,,,,1,
"The large shirts did run a little small so I had to return for the XL. However, they arrived early and the fit is great. Super light weight and breathable. Will be using on our bike trip to Sturgis. Pay attention to the tag. They cannot be put into the dryer but they will hang dry quickly!",,,1,,,,,,,
I love these shoes. They're very comfortable and fit my needs at home and going out. They are well designed and stable.,,,1,,,,,,,1
The product that I intially viewed and ordered had stripes on the interior. Upon recieving my toms I noticed that the interior had the animal graphics. Other than that these are probably the most comfortable shoes I have owned. Great buy.,,,1,,,,,,,1

"I bought my first pair of Adidas Superstar shoes in 1970 with my very first paycheck. They were the first leather sneakers on the market. And because they cost more than twice as much as the Converse All-Star, it took a while for them to appear on campus, creating an aura of cool from just the thought of them and the anticipation. It turned out I was the first person in my school to get a pair. Their striking appearance raised my social status overnight. I

As ever, this is a great, well-made, all-around, casual shoe.",,1,,,,1,1,,,1
I ordered this in white and it’s most definitely not white. It looks like a yellow white. I did love the fit and I will order it in a different color to try it out properly.,,,1,,,,1,,,
Got the red swimsuit in an xl and this suit fits great. Material is is very high quality. Can't believe the price for such a high quality suit.,,1,1,,,1,,,,
"Beautiful color and style. I found the color to be just like the image. I am a Medium all the time. The medium bottoms were loose, like you might lose the bottoms in the ocean. Coverage on top and bottom is minimal. I returned it 1) It showed too much skin for my age even though I could still rock it and 2) The top's band and the bottoms were slightly big.",,,1,,,1,,,,
Fit is true to size. I’m usually a small but wasn’t sure how it would fit so I ordered a small and medium. I am keeping the small! I ordered this same suit and it “got lost” so was worried this was a scam or something but I’m glad I took the risk bc I love this suit. It’s really hard to find ones like this right now since the style is trending.,,1,1,,,,,,,
"Way bigger than I thought. The Kirby outline is super dark. The underside is dark and you can see through the white front. The only good thing out of it is it’s pretty comfortable. The material feels nice, a little cheap though. I don’t think I would’ve gotten it if I knew it’d be like this though.",,1,1,,,1,,,,
"I was surprised at the nice feel of this shrug which is smooth, stretchy and not cheap looking at all. The price was great as a prime deal but even the regular price is fair. I normally wear a medium but accidentally ordered the Large which fit as I would expect. I'm returning it for the correct size and it'll be great over a tee or tank or sleeveless dress. It's shaped at the front to curve over the chest. Nice color selection too - the dusty blue was a pleasing balance of blue and gray that looks good with white hair! Haven't washed it yet so can't speak to how it will hold up.",,1,1,,,1,,,,
"This bolero cardigan is a true gem in my wardrobe. This cardigan has quickly become my go-to choice for almost all my outfits. I like the simple open front closure and how versatile it is across seasons. The 3/4 sleeves provide just the right amount of coverage, making it suitable for both warmer and cooler months. I particularly love wearing it in my super cold office, as it adds a light layer of warmth. The wide range of colors is wonderful, it's easy to find the perfect shade to complement any outfit. I pair it with sleeveless dresses, and I feel much more comfortable. I highly recommend this cardigan!",,,1,,,,,,,1
I bought this cardigan at the last minute for a trip and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and color. The fabric is very soft and not itchy or clingy. I did size up 1 size and it fits perfectly.,,1,1,,,,,,,
"I wanted a cropped look with a dress that has an empire waist. This gives a cropped look that hits just below that empire waist. Very fine knit, lightweight, lays on soft without slumping or drooping. Very pleased with this product!",,,1,,,,,,,1
These cropped sweatshirts are Awesome! They fit so nice! I would suggest to size up one size if you like to wear shirts underneath them to give you a little extra room. But if you only plan to wear like a tank top stay true to your size. I love them! ❤️,,,1,,,,,,,1
"Quality not great. Overpriced for what it is.
Material: not cotton; thin; no stitches at bottom
Overpriced for what it is. Not worth more than ~ $8.
Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product. I would not buy it again.",,1,,,,1,,,,
"  I expected the bottom to 
have an elastic band to it since it is cropped but it’s loose which 
caused it to rise up in an unflattering way. I would of returned it but I
 needed it on my trip and thought I could easily add it in but for those
 that can’t and like your jackets to fit, I’d say expect a loose fitting
 jacket. This is not a diss just a suggestion for a small adjustment. I 
have no pictures because it looked tacky and homier don’t play that lol

"I bought two different 
colors in size Large. One fit perfectly and the other was too small.  
The gray (listed as color 02 Print Dark) fit well, had nice stretch and 
good length.  Some may find the neck a bit constricting but overall it 
is a flattering design. I also bought the blue pattern (listed as Blue 
Tie Dye7) and will return it. The fabric did not have the same amount of
 stretch; the dress was too short for me and too snug.  I'm 5'9"" and 
170lb.  I would consider buying another color since the grey one fit 
well but it seems the fit and the fabric type is not consistent.

    Used this as a personal 
item on my Jet blue flight. Fits under the seat easily. Very comfortable
 and can be worn all day if you are out and about traveling. The bungie 
cords are super useful if you are traveling with a jacket. You can 
retrieve and store it very quickly by using the bungies. Would recommend
 purchasing!

This backpack is the perfect size for work. It has a padded spot for your laptop and all the accessories. There’s plenty of room for everything else. I also use it as an overnight bag. It’s comfortable and durable.,,,,1,,,,,,1
"Very
 lightweight, I take it to campus and I stuff my laptop, my tablets, my 
electronics organizer, some notebooks and pens and my lunch - and it's 
sooo comfortable. The backpack doesn't ""hang to the floor"" when you wear
 it, it maintains its shape and it's better for my back this way. 
Totally affordable also. Recommend. 5 stars!",,,,1,,1,,,,1
"Took
 this for our baby’s first trip to Hawaii. Kept her perfectly dry and 
protected from the humidity chill on rainy days. Love that this jacket 
helps our 10 month old stick with the philosophy of no bad weather only 
bad gear.
Also love that the North Face quality is apparent and holds
 true in even infant clothes. Will be purchasing more North Face gear 
for our little as time goes on.
Excellent quality and a must have item if you’re taking your child someplace wet!",,1,,,,1,1,,,
"







  
    This is a very good jacket 
that can be used for layering other hoodies under it. The main downside 
being it will not keep you warm and is very thin. It is water repellent 
but if you have lots of water being poured on you it will eventually get
 you wet. Another thing to keep in mind is the material has to get 
activated to be water repent after washing so make sure to throw it into
 the dryer in order for it to activate.

    I gave this a very good 
workout in the unnaturally rainy weather we've had since I bought it 
& it was excellent cover. I bought it a tad larger than I would 
normally have done so I can wear my North Face fleece jacket or my 
Mountain Hardwear down-filled puffer jacket under it for colder weather.
 My only parka is a Mountain Hardwear Absolute Zero, which is heaven 
from 10 degrees above to 50 or 60 below, but becomes a mobile sauna in 
temperatures closer to freezing. Between this shell & its underlying
 jackets & the parka, I'm good for anything from a rainstorm in the 
40's to a Himalayan expedition (I used to live at 10,000 feet in the 
Colorado Rockies where we DID see temperatures approaching 50 below at 
times & I spend time every winter in Minnesota's Iron Range or 
upwards toward Hudson Bay, so I do need the protection). So far, it has 
not shown any sign of wear after about 20 uses. Looks brand new. It gets
 a 93% 5-star rating on North Face's website and my only quibble is that
 the surface is DryVent 2L instead of my preferred GoreTex. But, that's 
just a minor issue since Mountain Hardwear's equivalent in GoreTex is 
almost $500.00!

"This
 coat was purchased for snow bicycling in a particularly cold, high 
altitude Utah winter. I am very particular about looks in a coat and 
warmth.

First of all, this is not a North Face or Arc Terex 
jacket. But look at the price tag. It is COMPLETELY worth the price, 
100%. It is very very warm and well built. I do think that the outer 
fabric is a tiny bit thin, but it does indeed protect from moisture. I 
would not say it’s waterproof, but more water resistant. My one gripe 
with this jacket is that the inner chest pocket zipper came to me sewn 
in backwards, rendering it basically useless. I love using my inner 
chest jacket pocket for my phone, so I was disappointed by that.

Overall,
 this is a very high quality coat for the price and I will purchase 
another one! I do think the sizes run a little big. I’m 5’11” 180lbs and
 I bought a large first. I was swimming in it. I sent it back to 
exchange for a medium and medium was a perfect fit!",,1,,,1,1,,,,1
"
 bought this coat because I walk to work six days a week. It's about a 
two mile walk and I live in west Michigan. I wanted something warm and 
had some water resistance. I'm 5 ""11 and around 175 -180 LBs. Medium 
fits with room to spare. I'm long through the torso  and have largish 
shoulders. I don't feel confined at all. Side pockets are usable for 
keeping my hands from freezing. They are a little shallow though. 
Zippers feel like they are well made as well as the fabric itself. 
Inside pocket is odd. Angled and a bit shallow. My glasses fell out one 
afternoon. Now I keep it zipped at all times. Front exterior chest 
pocket is easily accessible and deep. Odd choice for the deepest pocket 
but it will work. The hood when attached looks okay and not tacked on. 
It's decent sized for my big head and warm. During the rain the water 
did bead up on the coat so the resistance seems sound.
Only two 
complaints. For me this jacket can almost be too warm. Some kind of 
venting would be helpful. Temperature can start off near zero in the 
morning and rise up 40 degrees by the afternoon. Leaving unzipped is my 
compromise. It's not perfect but it keeps me from overheating. My other 
issue/non issues is the Velcro closures on the zipper cover on the 
front. Velcro screams cheap and it can sometimes wear quickly. And it 
also unintentionally attacheds itself to my bag strap at least one a 
day. That is not Velcro it's just worn. Snaps or buttons or I don't know
 magnets would of been better. And lastly that damn sound it makes 
irritates the crap out of me. But...mostly I lack confidence in it's 
longevity.
Overall a good bargain for a warm coat with a couple of mildly annoying features that at least to me weren't deal breakers.",,,1,,1,1,,,,
"Great
 price & true navy color as shown. Soft material and light cotton 
fabric. I like because not as heavy a chino-like IZOD or Dockers fabric.
 Great for hot weather. Quality zipper and buttons.
Con: 36 waist was just a bit tight, but like got material will start to stretch.
We’ll worth the purchase.
Due to thinner fabric for  longevity should probably wash cold and hang to dry.
Really worth the price.",,1,,,,1,,,,
"The
 green shorts are size 38 Redhead. They fit too loose - I can get my 
hand in at the waist and still have room to spare.  Other size 38 shorts
 I have fit the same as the Redhead. I thought if I went one size 
smaller, I would get a better fit. The khaki shorts are Amazon 
Essentials size 36 - one size smaller. They are about 4 - 5 inches too 
small at the waist. If I returned these shorts for a larger size - would
 I get size 40, 42?
The quality of the shorts are fine for everyday 
use. I've decided to return the shorts for a refund and mark Amazon 
Essentials off my list. Fool me once........",,,1,,,,1,,,
"Good product. Clean sewing. Bang for the buck! I bought 3 (blk, wht and grn). However it shrinks after a wash and tumble dry. My waist is 34 and it shrunk about 2 inches. You wanna get at least 1 inch larger. If you are 28, get 29. If you are 36, get 38 (based on shrink percentage)",,1,,,1,,,,,
"They
 fit a little tight for a size 33 that I got all my other 33s fit a 
little better. The shorts are nice. The problem is is they’re 
advertising as of now and these have been washed. I’m assuming returned a
 few times they didn’t come with any tags or anything on them just in a 
clear plastic bag. I would watch out as Amazon’s clearly just resending 
out things that other people have worn.",,,,,1,,,,1,
" Shorts are true to size 
which is the only positive thing I can say about them. Shorts are made 
in Bangladesh & the material isn't as quality made as like a nautica
 or polo shorts. This shorts material is very thin & the button is 
sowed on very cheaply. I just received these shorts today 5-20-23 & 
soon as I button the shorts up, it almost came off. I'm a sow the button
 on better & just use these shorts to lounge around in the house..

I bought the black versions
 of this shirt twice. I am a size small and was looking for something bc
 to wear at work. I work in a kitchen so it’s nice to have something 
slight light loose but also well fitted. I am 5’ 3 and weight roughly 
115 lbs and it fits great! Highly recommend. Great quality that is soft 
and sturdy at least for the black version. Was so good i went back and 
bought a second set of black shirts. It’s really hard for me to find 
good work clothes for a kitchen. We will see how long they last in the 
long run. Overall, amazing affordable option. :)

These shirts are extremely 
soft and stretchy. There is no structure to them at all. I ordered all 
XXL and the sleeve length and tightness varied in all 4 shirts I got. So
 did the scoop part of the neck. Som were super big and other were the 
right size but had wrong size sleeves. When I put the shirt on it felt 
like I slipped a soft stretchy tent over my body. My shoulders are 
17inch+ and the shoulders were to big. My breast are a 41in. And are no 
where to be found in this shirt. The material of this shirt clings to my
 mama belly like a advertisement saying I was pregnant or...yeah I ate a
 croissant for breakfast. Super clingy super soft. It's one of those I 
can wear this and be comfortable but ugly shirts. If that mid section 
muffin bothers you. I'm 5'10 193. And the arm pits on every shirt hit 
mid boob. I can't even tailor it because the sleeve around the arm is 
tight on 2 of them. I still love them. I DUNNO WHY!!!

Regular t-shirt.  About as 
thick as you'd expect but stretchy-er.  Nothing exceptional.  BUT.  
There are two huge tags and one smaller tag all sewn together into the 
left side of the t-shirt about half way down the side seam.  THEY ARE SO
 SO AGGRAVATING.  So, I tried to cut them out, but the frayed edges are 
no better and frankly, I inadvertently cut into the seam of course, 
causing a hole.  I will never purchase again, that's for sure.

 These are comfortable and look great. However the washing instructions make it impossible to include them with the rest of my wash.. ,,,1,,1,,,,,
The material is just what I’ve been looking for. The length is great. And the color selection is beautiful. But why or why do designers have to “bulk up” the material with too much “pocket pouch” and gathered elastic around the belly … exactly where women want to look the slimmest. I have returned too many otherwise perfect shorts and capris because of bulky/pouching pockets. ARGH!,,,1,,1,,,,,1
"The
 shorts are exactly as shown including the color. I took one star away 
because while the hip and waist fits great the short legs narrow quickly
 and are too tight around my thighs. I bought a 12 and I don’t have 
disproportionally large legs and haven’t had this issue with other 
brands.  If I went up a size the waist and hips would be too big. So 
returning and looking for an alternative.
 I took the second star 
away because of the fabric. I don’t even no what to compare it to. Maybe
 a tent material. It would probably dry quickly if it got wet but 
doesn’t seem very breathable. I could be wrong but not a fan of how they
 feel.",,1,,,,,,,,1

"If
 you have the money to invest in this webcam, I highly suggest making 
the purchase. Logitech has a great reputation when it comes to the 
webcam sector. I have several webcams and this is now my favorite. 
Hopefully, this review helps with any decision you are trying to make.",,1,,,,,1,,1,
"I
 have a regular old 1080p webcam that works but I figured I'd try and 
upgrade to see if it would be worth it for me. Like lots of other folks,
 I'm working from home/remotely so having a webcam for my desktop is a 
necessity. The picture quality and clarity on my current webcam is good 
however it is a tad on the bright side. I've fiddled with the settings 
as best I can but, it is what it is. I get decent picture quality and 
the mic is good as well.

I saw this one on sale so I figured this
 would be a nice, if not somewhat steep, upgrade for me. I bit the 
bullet and decided to give this a shot. The picture quality on this 
camera is much better so no surprise there. It has a wider view angle 
so, for better or worse, you can see my whole torso rather than just my 
neck/head with my other camera. The mic is also a bit better than mine 
however, I've not had any issues with conference calls with my other 
camera.

So it really boiled down to the cost of this upgrade. My 
current camera was fairly inexpensive at around $50 or so. This one was 
almost triple the price so it was pretty difficult justifying this 
considering I would get something, relatively speaking, marginally 
better than my current camera. As mentioned before, it has great wide 
angle viewing and picture quality to match. For me it was all about the 
price and that it was just too steep for having an upgraded camera.

If
 you don't have a webcam or have a severely outdated one then, yes, this
 would be great pickup as the 4k resolution should carry you through for
 quite some time. But, for me, the costs outweighed the benefits so it 
was a no-go for me unfortunately.",,1,,,,,1,,1,
"I love the color, and the textured side,and the size is good too. I was hoping it would be big enough and it looks like it will be. I gave it a 4 because of weird smell on the inside.

"Even at half price, I am returning this purse. The vegan leather is very soft, but the inside finishes aren't great. The two slots where I like to put my glasses, aren't deep enough, so you can't zip up the purse. The inside lining feels like tent fabric, makes noise, not soft like a nice fabric lining.

"Look nice and my daughter likes them, but the sizing is irregular. People are not the same size on both sides so a slightly different fit is expected, but these shoes go beyond that.

"TOMS sizing is quite inconsistent. This is my fourth pair of TOMS. This is only the second pair of regular canvas TOMS. One pair was sequined, the other way one of the limited edition kinds that is made of a different fabric (not sure which fabric it was). Depending on which fabric they're made from seems to determine how they fit. These canvas ones are very narrow across the top of my foot, rubbing and pinching. I order a 9.5 at first, but they were pinchy, so I ordered a 10. The 10 is better, but still tight across the top of my fit... but not also a bit long. My first pair were the most comfortable shoes I owned for a while, but these new ones I just got are some of the most uncomfortable. When they fit right, they feel so nice. When they fit poorly, it's really bad. It's hit or miss with these.",,1,1,,,,,,,
They were great just a bit too tight,,,1,,,,,,,
I bought these for my sister. She loves it. Looks really nice. She said she would buy again from TOMS.,,,,,,,1,,,1
I resisted getting toms for awhile (i thought they were ugly) but I tried on a pair and they felt great. I ordered off amazon because as a prime member I get them shipped so quickly and no b&m stores can match their price. Great purchase,,,1,,,,1,,1,1
Very excellent,,,,,,,1,,,
"These shoes are pretty awesome. Buying a pair supports a great cause in impoverished countries. But aside from that, these are super comfortable shoes especially in warm climates when you don't feel like wearing socks. They might not be the most durable shoe in the world but think about the good deed that is done when you buy a pair for yourself and a poor kid without shoes is presented a new pair thanks to your purchase. Way cool idea. I recommend you go buy some TOMS eye wear too.",,,1,,,,1,,,
"I finally caved and bought a pair of TOMS for casual summer wear with shorts when flip flops aren't appropriate. They feel like they slip on my foot a little bit, and they don't have much traction, so I wouldn't wear them if it's wet outside.  They're cute with shorts, and they protect my feet, so I'm not complaining. The color is great.",,,1,,,,,,,1
"I wear them everyday.  All day.  This is my second pair.  I wore my first ones out in a year.....but I abuse them, get them wet. step on the backs, and snag the toes.  My old pair has been hand repaired and sewn, but still usable.  My new pair is my fancy pair.",,1,,,1,,,,,
"These are one of my favorite pairs of shoes, but I had to return for a half size smaller and wish I would have gotten a full size smaller.  They stretch a lot.  Otherwise a great product, I plan to get different colors!",,,1,,,,,,,1
Love them.,,,,,,,1,,,
Thanks!,,,,,1,,,,,
Fast shipping. Great product,,,,,,,,,1,
Never can go wrong with Toms,,,,,,,1,,,
This didn't fit as expected. Had to return due to being too tight.,,,1,,,,,,,
These were very cute but too small so I had to return them. I might get them in the next size up.,,,1,,,,,,,1
I had been looking for Toms in several stores but I tried online and as long as you know your shoesize you are good to go!,,,,,,,1,,,
They are even cutier in person & they are very comfortable & easy to match with anything you wear casual or dressey,,,1,1,,,,,,
"LOVE these Toms!! I bought them a half size smaller than what I usually wear (8.5 instead of 9), and they fit very nicely - still roomy in the toe area and comfortable to be worn all day. With a half size down, they won't be able to be worn with socks until they are more ""broken in,"" but they are perfect to be worn without socks. These are very cute, versatile shoes - everyone should own a pair!",,,1,1,,,,,,1
Love!,,,,,1,,,,,
The first time it was so big. But now I have the right size. They arrive perfectly!!!,,,1,,1,,,,,
Just what we wanted.,,,,,1,,,,,
I bought these shoes as a Christmas present for my 16 year old son and he absolutely loves them! I really like that this company (Toms) donates a pair of shoes for every pair it sells.,,,,,1,,1,,,
"Toms are Toms are Toms. If you've had them before, you aren't reading this. So I'll target it towards those who are new to Toms.

I hover between a 7.5 and an 8, and always get the 8 in Toms. That being said, they are still always a little tight across the top for me when I first put them on.  DON'T RETURN THEM IF THIS IS THE SAME FOR YOU!  They will loosen to fit your foot in a half an hour or so.

Other than that quick fit note, Toms are always great. Comfortable and long lasting (especially for a canvas shoe).",,1,1,,,,1,,,
Nice!,,,,,1,,,,,
Perfect fit! super comfy and cute!,,,1,,,,,,,1
"I don't think they make an 11.5 size, but for some reason I remember the last pair I had were more snug. They still fit pretty well.",,,1,,,,,,,
Love them!!!,,,,,1,,,,,
"I literally wear these shoes ALL the time! When it is a bit cooler outside, I look like a fool with socks on with them. By far the BEST investment I have made with my money.
I would HIGHLY recommend these to anyone!",,,1,1,,,,,,
I LOVE MY RED TOMS,,,,,,,1,,,
"I love these shoes! I bought my first pair last summer in black and I basically wore it until it fell apart. It has holes on it and some areas of the soles are just totally worn out but I still wear it sometimes because it's really comfortable. I wear it to school and at work ( I work at a restaurant so I am always on my feet, pacing around). I think it held up pretty well, and thinking that a pair is donated to the needy, I thought it's nice to buy more which I did. I bought two more pairs, one in white and another one in olive green but they didn't fit as well as the first pair I had even though I bought the same size. It was a little lose, so the shoe comes off when I walk. I bought an insole and it helped a little bit on the olive green pair but the white ones I had to return which is too bad. So, I guess just be a little careful with their sizing because reading the reviews on here and on the Toms website, it seems like there are some inconsistencies with it. Also, when you wear these shoes everyday, make sure to wash it. I wash my pair with the dark clothes and I never had a problem with the dye running. It made the shoes look cooler because it has this worn out look now. Never put it in the dryer; just put it by the windowsill and keep your feet clean because these shoes, even though very breathable can stink up your feet if you're not going to take care of it.

Just like others, I also think these shoes are a little overpriced and there are a bunch of similar styles now for half the price. I just try to keep in mind that the company is doing goodwill by donating a pair to those in need. These shoes are still my favorite for walking around downtown and to wear at work.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"IT looks good but even though it was the size requested, it is a bit tight",,,1,,,,,,,
So comfortable and go with everything,,,1,1,,,,,,
Very comfortable and true to size. This is my first pair of TOMS but I'm already looking to order a matching pair for my daughter and I!,,,1,,1,,,,,
Perfect! Flawless! Comfortable!,,,1,,,,,,,
Awesome shoes! You guys are my go to for anything Tom's because it's really hard to find them in 14! Thank you!!!!,,,,,,,1,,1,
They are what I expected.,,,,,1,,,,,
Received these as a gift from my mom. My other Toms are size 8. So I figured all Toms would run the same. Sadly I am unable to return because my mom ordered them around Christmas and just sent them to me about a month ago. I love the look and would wear them if they fit. I guess ordering Toms online is not the best of ideas.,,,1,,,,,,1,
Nice quality,,1,,,,,,,,
"I want to give 5 stars so bad because I love what TOMS stands for but I didn't get a chance to wear them and had to return them so I'll give them a 3. FYI the sole of the shoe is made of pig skin (leather), this is not a vegan shoe.",,1,,,,,1,,,
Purchased as Christmas gift for daughter in law.  She loves them and says they are comfortable enough to wear all day.,,,1,,,,1,,,
All great shoes,,,,,1,,,,,
i didn't think they would fit but they did . Fit a little big but thats ok,,,1,,,,,,,
I love Toms and these crochet ones are amazing!,,,,,,,1,,,
Very comfortable! Great shoe for summer. Ordered my normal size and they fit just fine. Very happy with purchase.,,,1,,,,,,,
"I already have a pair of this shoes and wanted a second pair.  I had to get them 1/2 size larger than my regular size though; they fit tight.  However, they are one of the most comfortable shoes I own when standing most of the day",,,1,,,,,,,
These are not black. They are dark brown,,,,,,,,,,1
"If you have high arches, then don't bother with Toms. They're made for flat-footed people.",,,1,,,,,,,
I love my toms shoes so much I am wearing them out!  These are a great color and goes with everything.  Going to have to get another pair!,,,,1,,,,,,1
"These shoes are wonderful and full of sparkle!  The small flecks of sparkle can fade off with wear, but they still maintain the overall look.

Like all TOMS shoes, they seem snug when you first put them on, but they WILL stretch out.  Make sure to keep that in mind when ordering.",,,1,,,,,,,
Love my shoes,,,,,1,,,,,
"These shoes are perfect for me, I love them with black tights. I did purchase a half size smaller than my usual shoe size for a perfect fit.",,,1,,,,,,,1
"They run a bit narrow, but seem like they'll stretch a little as I break them in. The size was accurate otherwise.",,,1,,,,,,,
Love these. Super comfy!,,,1,,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my daughter she loves them,,,,,1,,,,,
"Very nice shoes. I thought them to go with my skinny jeans and chinos. They were very tight at first, but after about a weak of living in foot hell, they stretched out and things are amazing now. Very strong and durable. I even when hiking in the Arizona mountains with these bad boys. Still going strong. A must have for anyone rockin' skinny attire.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"I like. But i was expecting another color inside  and  also, my size is usually nine ,nine and a half for me big.",,,1,,,,,,,1
I dislike it. It's not like what I expected they are not comfortable I think they are not original,,,1,,1,,,,,
The size was way to big,,,1,,,,,,,
Alway Love toms,,,,,,,1,,,
Great!,,,,,1,,,,,
the elastic and top is really constraining fits smaller then all my other toms but they are beautiful so I reordered one size up,,1,1,,,,,,,1
"Love my Toms, and I getmto send some to a child",,,,,1,,,,,
Love it fits perfectly,,,1,,,,,,,
"Normally, Toms are about a size too big (8 if you normally wear 8.5, etc). These felt like they were size 7.5! I can wear size 8 most of the time just fine but these were positively tiny in comparison to what the size said.",,,1,,,,,,,
beautiful and sparkly,,,,,,,,,,1
Like loos fit and comfort,,,1,,,,,,,
I have tried THREE different phone numbers and an email address all for shoemerica who sold me the shoes.... No one will answer any of them or respond to my email. All I want to do is exchange them for a size smaller.  I am angry because it is a gift and this is an impossible task it seems.  Shoemerica clearly doesn't care about customer service.  It has been almost two weeks and countless emails / calls... Still no response.,,,,,,,,,1,
Veryncomfortable you could ware it with anythig,,,1,1,,,,,,
Loved them,,,,,1,,,,,
Purchased the white pair and they were stained yellow around the stitching,,1,,,,,,,,
Comfy enough to wear all day in my classroom!,,,1,,,,,,,
the shoes went really well with the outfits i had in mind they are amazing and when i mean it i mean it,,,,1,,,,,,1
was disappointed when they arrived the box said size 8 but in the box was a size 7 could not return them because i lost the return tag,,,,,1,,,,1,
"I ordered my TOMS and it came packaged in it's original shoe box but without the dust bag but it's ok, I luv my new shoe",,,,,1,,,1,,
"Comfortable, light, looks nice. Price is kind of high for this type of shoes, but you pay for the brand.",,,1,,,,,,,
Very comfortable.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Love them, good quality and comfortable as hell",,,1,,,,,,,
Confortable as always.  I decided black in black to see if I can keep then cleaner :).  I bought it half size down as I always do with Toms.,,,1,,,,,,,
"I tried the other brand that looks like Tom's and claims to fit as well.  NOT TRUE! If you are looking for a comfortable pair of shoes and you like the look of these--spend the extra money and buy Tom's.  The other brand cannot compare.  In most shoes I wear a 7 1/2, but I purchased a 7 in these.  They did stretch to fit my feet and are extremely comfortable.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"I have twice ordered Toms, and twice had to send them back. I tried to get advice from their customer service but I don't think they even bother to read the mails. Very tight shoes - & I have narrow feet, and too small. I'm so annoyed.",,,1,,1,,,,1,
Cute comfy little summer shoes!,,,1,1,,,,,,
The product is exactly what I expected. Fit perfectly. The color is the same of the picture.,,,1,,1,,,,,1
"Could not have been happier with my purchase!!! Arrived on time and the fit was perfect...toms run a bit big, I wear a 5 1/2, but the 5 fits best :)",,,1,,,,,,1,
I'm a 7 1/2 and went down a half size because the shoe will stretch. The rope on the sole is not fraying or coming apart after a few wears like others say. Love them!,,,1,,,,,,,
These fit perfect and I love how much shock absorbing the soles are. Easy to get in and off.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Bought these in red. I went .5 up . I wear a 8 and got 8.5. Didn't fit , I guess because my foot is wide. I like the shoes though. They were good sending and returning my refund.",,,,,,,,,1,1
This was a gift and did not disappoint with TOMS brand reliability in comfortable support and classic look. Would definitely buy TOMS from this source again.,,,,,1,,,,,
I love them,,,,,1,,,,,
Bought these for my wife she really loves them :),,,,,1,,,,,
Bought these Tom's for my adult daughter.  She says she loves them and is wearing them all the time.  Got a good price.,,,,,1,1,,,,
My other Toms I ordered a size 6 (usually where 6.5) and they fit great. These were much too big so I have to return and get a size 5.5. Not sure why the sizing is so much different.,,,1,,,,,,1,
"Love how even the sole is black.  A little tight at first, but loosened up after a couple of wears.",,,1,,,,,,,
"They're really awesome! They were perfect when they arrive, and it came really fast! If you don't like the plain ones or the designed ones, you can just get them to paint or decorate.",,,,,1,,,,,1
