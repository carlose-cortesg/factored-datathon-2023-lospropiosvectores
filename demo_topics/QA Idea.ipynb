      "  The good part first: Toms create cute shoes. They make them likable and appealing to the eye of a customer. Also the fabric is light weight, causing the shoe not to be heavy. Now let's say you buy a pair of Toms and want to do some charity work as well; if you buy a pair of the shoes, then the company will send a pair for free to a kid in need.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Toms cons outweigh the pros. For example, the item is really expensive, ranging from $30.00 to $100.00. If you step in a puddle or go to a water park or in the rain with the shoes on, they will shrink against your feet. Let's say that you're wearing Toms and someone steps on your shoe with their dirty muddy ones. What happens then? The shoe stains no matter the color of the Toms. No big deal you say, but when you wash them or clean for several hours to get the stain out, not only do the shoes shrink, but also they wear out and the stain doesn't go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Even though I like the fact that they give a free pair of Toms to people in need with every purchase of the shoes that you make, I want you to think to yourself, \"Is it really worth that much money with little pleasure in return?\" Even though the company does make cute shoes, if you look at the details of the item (fabric, price, sustainability) instead of the big picture (looks) then you shouldn't buy Toms for your daily shoe.\n",

      "I've been told by \"expert\" Toms sales personnel (at Nordstroms) to buy one full size down and I've been doing that. It's a bit easier in a store but I have less confidence purchasing online when I don't have the shoe on my feet.  But this time, I decided to order a 6.5 when I wear a 7.5.  The shoe arrived, I put them on, they felt a bit snug but I had ordered some Toms online in a 7.5 and they are now too loose, comfy but too loose and my feet slide to the side too much.  These 6.5 ones loosened up within a half hour of wear inside the house.  I am very happy about the fit as well as the striping.  They look great!\n",

      "Love these shoes! Fit great and look nice with just about anything.  Super comfy and easy to wear! Highly recommend.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "I needed another throw around type of shoe that I could just slide on. I grabbed these and am happy with them so far. The sizing does run big, I normally wear a 9.5 and I went down to an 8.5 for these (which is still a tad big, considering they do stretch). However, they are still very comfortable despite being so skimpy and thin. The material is easy to clean and they look new after I clean them with mild soap and a damp rag. I haven't worn them enough to comment on durability, but am enjoying them so far.\n",
